# Product Vision — CodeCap (Desktop MVP)

**Primary outcome:** Help users instantly capture code or text from any app, preserve formatting, and turn it into organized, reusable knowledge with AI assistance.

## Personas
- **Developers:** snippets, commands, configs, code patterns.
- **POs/PMs:** acceptance criteria, user stories, descriptions.
- **Students/Learners:** examples, study notes, references.

## Value Proposition
- Snagit-style capture + OCR → fast intake from *any* source.
- AI summaries and tags → less cognitive load.
- Minimal, focused UI → quick capture, quick reuse.
- Private by default → content stays local unless you opt into cloud AI.

## MVP Goals
- Reliable capture and OCR with preserved indentation.
- Simple organization (tags, categories, projects).
- Lightweight AI summarization and tag suggestions.
- Basic sharing (invite, view, comment).

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- Team workspaces, real-time multi-user editing, enterprise SSO.
- Web/mobile clients (desktop only for MVP).
